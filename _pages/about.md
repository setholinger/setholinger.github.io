![Rift Seismicity.](images/riftquake.png)

Predicting and reacting to changes in the cryosphere as Earth's climate warms requires a robust understanding of Antarctic ice dynamics, yet many key processes that influence mass loss and state of stress in Antarctic ice shelves are poorly understood. In my work, I use seismological data and mechanical modeling to study rifting, the ice fracture process that leads to the calving of tabular icebergs.

__Highlights of my research include:__

* Characterizing the first seismic recordings of kilometer-scale rift extension.
* Modeling the bending of floating ice shelves in response to rifting.
* Detecting, cataloging, and locating rift fracture events in continuous seismic data.
* Investigating the relationship between tidal stresses and rift fracture.
